# Challenge 1

Read about the challenge [here](./Task.md)

## What did I do

I wrote a concept and left it there for reference. From there I tackled the challenge with a simple CLI tool.

The CLI has two commands

-   `load` - creates a "Catalog" Tree from a json file
-   `build` - Runs a continuous prompt to build a Catalog element by element

## Start the app

create a virtual environment and install the requirements

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate # or venv\Scripts\activate.bat on windows
```

install the requirements

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

start the app

```bash
python cli.py <COMMAND>
```

Completion in 5 hours
